      <description>The analysis illustrates how a simple mathematical model can be applied to experimental data of tissue resident memory T cells in nonlymphoid tissues. The aim is to estimate the clonal half-life of each population and project dynamics beyond experimental timeframes.
Full details of the model can be found in Morris et al (2019) Journal of Immunology [In press].</description>

      <description>In 2017, HIV/AIDS was responsible for the deaths of one million people globally, including 50,000 children less than one year old. Although mathematical modeling has provided important insights into the dynamics of HIV infection during anti-retroviral treatment (ART), there is still a lack of accessible tools for researchers unfamiliar with modeling techniques to apply them to their own datasets.
ushr is an open-source R package that models the decline of HIV during ART using a popular mathematical framework.</description>
