      <description>Background: simple SIS model Let’s start by refreshing the basics of the SIS model. Susceptible individuals (\(S\)) become infected and move into the infected class (\(I\)), and then infected individuals who recover move straight back to the susceptible class (so there’s no period of immunity like in the SIR model). For simplicity we will ignore births and death, and also use a proportional model i.e. \(S\) + \(I\) = \(N\) = 1.</description>

      <description>Event: Summer bootcamp for infectious disease modeling
Location: The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo
Event URL: https://sites.google.com/site/modelinfection/home/shortcourse4
Lecture: The purpose of my guest lecture was to introduce students to ways in which the SIR model can be applied to real disease outbreaks. I focussed on a past project that developed a statistical SIR framework to model the spatiotemporal dynamics of dolphin morbillivirus. The slides from this talk are below.

      <description>Introduction In class we covered the SIR model with births and deaths. Assuming the birth rate is equal to the death rate (\(\mu\)) gives:
\[\begin{align*} \frac{dS}{dt} &amp;amp;= \mu N -\beta S I - \mu S\\ \frac{dI}{dt} &amp;amp;= \beta S I - \gamma I - \mu I\\ \frac{dR}{dt} &amp;amp;= \gamma I - \mu R. \end{align*}\]
So what do these terms mean? Suppose the unit of time we are considering is days, then</description>
