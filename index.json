We use simple epidemiological models to explore estimates for the magnitude and timing of future Covid-19 cases given different protective efficacy and duration of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, as well as its interaction with vaccines and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We find that variations in the immune response to primary SARS-CoV-2 infections and a potential vaccine can lead to dramatically different immune landscapes and burdens of critically severe cases, ranging from sustained epidemics to near elimination. Our findings illustrate likely complexities in future Covid-19 dynamics, and highlight the importance of immunological characterization beyond the measurement of active infections for adequately projecting the immune landscape generated by SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\n*The interactive shiny app I created for this paper that can be found [here](https://grenfelllab.shinyapps.io/sarscov2/).*","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Immune life history, vaccination, and the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 over the next 5 years","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600646400,"objectID":"07fec66952abf1eb3778074dad22ae47","permalink":"/project/covid/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/covid/","section":"project","summary":"Companion shiny app to Saad-Roy et al. 2020 *Science*","tags":["Other"],"title":"SARS-CoV-2 shiny app","type":"project"},{"authors":["**SE Morris**","L Dziobek-Garrett","R Strehlau","J Schröter","S Shiau","AJN Anelone","M Paximadis","RJ de Boer","EJ Abrams","CT Tiemessen","L Kuhn","AJ Yates"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1592784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592784000,"objectID":"9793c0732bba911b2f12f5ef83b9b8f9","permalink":"/publication/jaids/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jaids/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background**: Mathematical modeling has provided important insights into HIV infection dynamics in adults undergoing antiretroviral treatment (ART). However, much less is known about the corresponding dynamics in perinatally-infected neonates initiating early ART. **Setting**: From 2014-2017, HIV viral load (VL) was monitored in 122 perinatally-infected infants identified at birth and initiating ART within a median of two days. Pre-treatment infant and maternal covariates, including CD4 T cell counts and percentages, were also measured. **Methods**: From the initial cohort, 53 infants demonstrated consistent decline and suppressed VL below the detection threshold (20 copies/ml) within one year. For 43 of these infants with sufficient VL data, we fit a mathematical model describing the loss of short and long-lived infected cells during ART. We then estimated the lifespans of infected cells and the time to viral suppression, and tested for correlations with pre-treatment covariates. **Results**: The majority of parameters governing the kinetics of VL decline were consistent with those obtained previously from adults and other infants. However, our estimates of the lifespan of short-lived infected cells were longer than published values. This difference may reflect sparse sampling during the early stages of VL decline, when the loss of short-lived cells is most apparent. In addition, infants with higher pre-treatment CD4 percentage or lower pre-treatment VL trended towards more rapid viral suppression. **Conclusions**: HIV dynamics in perinatally-infected neonates initiating early ART are broadly similar to those observed in other age groups. Accelerated viral suppression is also associated with higher CD4 percentage and lower VL.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Quantifying the dynamics of HIV decline in perinatally-infected neonates on antiretroviral therapy","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["talks"],"content":"From the RockEDU event page:\n\u0026ldquo;This week on Data for the People, postdocs Chloe Pasin and Sinead Morris will talk about how scientists are applying hypothetical modeling and math to predict what can happen when social distancing rules are lifted at different time points, and using different strategies.

By mathematically fitting the data, important biological parameters can then be estimated, including the lifespans of short and long-lived infected cells, and the time to reach viral suppression below a defined detection threshold. The package also provides visualization and summary tools for fast assessment of model results. **Conclusions**:`ushr` enables researchers without a strong mathematical or computational background to model the dynamics of HIV using longitudinal clinical data.

Here we discuss how results from different systems shed light on the ecological dynamics of TRM in mice and humans. We highlight the importance of dissecting processes contributing to TRM maintenance, and how these might vary across phenotypically and spatially heterogeneous subsets.

Although infection induces a strong MV-specific immune response that clears viral load and confers lifelong immunity, transient immunosuppression can also occur, leaving the host vulnerable to colonization from secondary pathogens. This apparent contradiction of viral clearance in the face of immunosuppression underlies what is often referred to as the ‘measles paradox’, and remains poorly understood. To explore the mechanistic basis underlying the measles paradox, and identify key factors driving viral clearance, we return to a previously published dataset of MV infection in rhesus macaques. These data include virological and immunological information that enable us to fit a mathematical model describing how the virus interacts with the host immune system. In particular, our model incorporates target cell depletion through infection of host immune cells—a hallmark of MV pathology that has been neglected from previous models. We find the model captures the data well, and that both target cell depletion and immune activation are required to explain the overall dynamics. Furthermore, by simulating conditions of increased target cell availability and suppressed cellular immunity, we show that the latter causes greater increases in viral load and delays to MV clearance. Overall, this signals a more dominant role for cellular immunity in resolving acute MV infection. Interestingly, we find contrasting dynamics dominated by target cell depletion when viral fitness is increased. This may have wider implications for animal morbilliviruses, such as canine distemper virus (CDV), that cause fatal target cell depletion in their natural hosts. To our knowledge this work represents the first fully calibrated within-host model of MV dynamics and, more broadly, provides a new platform from which to explore the complex mechanisms underlying Morbillivirus infection.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Modeling the measles paradox reveals the importance of cellular immunity in regulating viral clearance","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542276000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542276000,"objectID":"51b2a395521a6686a45c20065931f705","permalink":"/talk/epiical/","publishdate":"2018-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/epiical/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Mathematical and statistical modeling of HIV decay dynamics in perinatally-infected infants on ART","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**SE Morris**","B Freiesleben de Blasio","C Viboud","A Wesolowski","ON Bjørnstad","BT Grenfell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1526515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526515200,"objectID":"7646ec44ed31e680a2974e7742fd2414","permalink":"/publication/flu/","publishdate":"2018-05-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/flu/","section":"publication","summary":"Population structure, spatial diffusion, and climatic conditions mediate the spatiotemporal spread of seasonal influenza in temperate regions. However, much of our knowledge of these dynamics stems from a few well-studied countries, such as the United States (US), and the extent to which this applies in different demographic and climatic environments is not fully understood. Using novel data from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, we applied wavelet analysis and non-parametric spatial statistics to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of influenza transmission at regional and international scales. We found the timing and amplitude of epidemics were highly synchronized both within and between countries, despite the geographical isolation of many areas in our study. Within Norway, this synchrony was most strongly modulated by population size, confirming previous findings that hierarchical spread between larger populations underlies seasonal influenza dynamics at regional levels. However, we found no such association when comparing across countries, suggesting that other factors become important at the international scale. Finally, to frame our results within a wider global context, we compared our findings from Norway to those from the US. After correcting for differences in geographic scale, we unexpectedly found higher levels of synchrony in Norway, despite its smaller population size. We hypothesize that this greater synchrony may be driven by more favorable and spatially uniform climatic conditions, although there are other likely factors we were unable to consider (such as reduced variation in school term times and differences in population movements). Overall, our results highlight the importance of comparing influenza spread at different spatial scales and across diverse geographic regions in order to better understand the complex mechanisms underlying disease dynamics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Analysis of multi-level spatial data reveals strong synchrony in seasonal influenza epidemics across Norway, Sweden, and Denmark","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" Background: simple SIS model Let’s start by refreshing the basics of the SIS model. Susceptible individuals (\\(S\\)) become infected and move into the infected class (\\(I\\)), and then infected individuals who recover move straight back to the susceptible class (so there’s no period of immunity like in the SIR model). For simplicity we will ignore births and death, and also use a proportional model i.e. \\(S\\) + \\(I\\) = \\(N\\) = 1. The basic flow diagram is shown below.\n An example simulation of this model is shown in Figure 1, and the corresponding equations are\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dS}{dt} \u0026amp;= - \\beta S I + \\gamma I\\\\ \\frac{dI}{dt} \u0026amp;= \\beta S I - \\gamma I. \\end{align*}\\]  Figure 1: Example simulation of the simple SIS model with \\(\\gamma = 7\\) day\\(^{-1}\\), \\(R_0 = 3\\) and \\(\\beta = R_0\\times \\gamma\\).  If we focus on just the \\(I\\) equation, then we can eliminate \\(S\\) by using the fact that \\(S + I = 1 \\Rightarrow S = 1 - I\\). So\n\\[\\begin{align} \\frac{dI}{dt} \u0026amp;= \\beta S I - \\gamma I \\nonumber\\\\ \\Rightarrow ~~~ \\frac{dI}{dt} \u0026amp; = \\beta (1 - I) I - \\gamma I\\label{eqn:SIS}. \\end{align}\\] This will makes things simpler when we come to calculating \\(R_0\\) for the extended malaria model.\nTransmission rate In this simple SIS model, the effective transmission rate, \\(\\beta\\), can be thought of as the product of the number of contacts per individual (per unit time) and the probability that each of these independent contacts will result in infection i.e.\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\beta \u0026amp;= (\\#~contacts~per~individual) \\times (prob.~infection) \\end{align*}\\]   Incorporating human-mosquito interactions To extend the simple SIS model above to malaria dynamics, we need to account for both human and mosquito populations in our model equations.\nTo do this, we define \\(S_h\\) and \\(I_h\\) to represent the proportion of humans that are susceptible and infected, respectively, and \\(S_m\\)/ \\(I_m\\) to represent the proportion of mosquitos that are susceptible/ infected. A basic flow diagram is shown below.\nNote that in contrast to the human population, which recover at rate \\(\\gamma_h\\), we assume that mosquitos do not recover from disease, and instead die at rate \\(\\gamma_m\\).\n Similar to the simple SIS model, we assume \\(S_h = 1 - I_h\\), and \\(S_m = 1 - I_m\\). We can then modify our equation for \\(dI/dt\\) above to describe the proportion infected in both the human and mosquito populations.\nHumans First, for infected humans, we know that each new infected case can only arise when a susceptible human (\\(S_h = 1 - I_h\\)) comes into contact (i.e. is bitten) by an infected mosquito (\\(I_m\\)). Therefore,\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dI_h}{dt} \u0026amp; = \\beta_h (1 - I_h) I_m - \\gamma_h I_h, \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\beta_h\\) is the effective transmission rate of humans being infected by mosquitos. Similar to the simple SIS model above, we can think of \\(\\beta_h\\) as the product of the number of mosquito contacts (i.e. bites) per human (per unit time) and the probability that each independent bite will result in infection i.e.\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\beta_h \u0026amp;= (\\#~contacts~per~human) \\times (prob.~infection~from~mosquito)\\\\ \u0026amp; = ~~~(\\#~bites~per~human) ~~\\times (prob.~infection~from~mosquito). \\end{align*}\\] At this stage, notice that we can express the \\(\\# ~bites ~per ~human\\) as \\[\\begin{align*} (\\#~bites~per~human) ~ \u0026amp;= ~(\\# ~bites ~per ~mosquito) ~\\times ~(\\# ~mosquitos ~per ~human) \\end{align*}\\] (To think about this intuitively, from the perspective of a susceptible human, we would expect the number of times they are bitten to increase if there are (1) more mosquitos around AND (2) if the mosquitos around are biting more frequently.) This means that we can then write\n\\[\\begin{align} \\beta_h\u0026amp; = (\\#~bites~per~mosquito) \\times (\\#~mosquitos~per~human) \\times (prob.~infection~from~mosquito)\\nonumber\\\\ \u0026amp; = ~~~~~~a ~~~~~~\\times~~~~~~ m ~~~~~~\\times ~~~~~~b\\label{eqn:bites}. \\end{align}\\]  Mosquitos Similarly, for infected mosquitos, we know that each new infected case can only arise when a susceptible mosquito (\\(S_m = 1 - I_m\\)) comes into contact (i.e. bites) an infected human (\\(I_h\\)). Therefore,\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dI_m}{dt} \u0026amp; = \\beta_m (1 - I_m) I_h - \\gamma_m I_m, \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\beta_m\\) is the effective transmission rate of mosquitos being infected by humans. Similar to above, we can think of \\(\\beta_m\\) as the product of the number of human contacts (i.e. bites) per mosquito (per unit time) and the probability that each independent bite will result in infection i.e.\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\beta_m \u0026amp;= (\\#~contacts~per~mosquito) \\times (prob.~infection~from~human)\\\\ \u0026amp; = ~~~(\\#~bites~per~mosquito) ~~~\\times (prob.~infection~from~human). \\end{align*}\\] Notice that this expression is slighty simpler than the earlier expression for \\(\\beta_h\\), since we already know the # bites per mosquito (it’s just equal to \\(a\\) as we defined in equation ()!). Therefore,\n\\[\\begin{align} \\beta_m \u0026amp; = (\\#~bites~per~mosquito) \\times (prob.~infection~from~human)\\nonumber\\\\ \u0026amp; = ~~~~~~a ~~~~~~\\times~~~~~~c. \\end{align}\\]  Combining equations Substituting \\(\\beta_h = amb\\) and \\(\\beta_m = ac\\) into our differential equations then gives the extended SIS model for malaria transmission between humans and mosquitos:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dI_h}{dt} \u0026amp; = amb (1 - I_h) I_m - \\gamma_h I_h\\\\ \\frac{dI_m}{dt} \u0026amp; = ac (1 - I_m) I_h - \\gamma_m I_m. \\end{align*}\\] An example simulation of these equations is shown in Figure 2.\n Figure 2: Example simulation of the SIS malaria model with \\(\\gamma_h = 7\\) day\\(^{-1}\\), \\(\\gamma_m = 3\\) day\\(^{-1}\\), \\(m = 2, a = 4, b = 0.05\\), and \\(c = 0.09\\) (so again \\(R_0 \\sim 3\\)).    Finding \\(R_0\\) To find \\(R_0\\) we want to focus on the human population (i.e. we want to know how many secondary human infections are likely to occur). Doing this requires making some simplifying assumptions about the mosquito population.\nSpecifically, for this class, we will assume that the mosquito dynamics are already at equilibrium (i.e. \\(dI_m/dt = 0\\)). As an example, this could represent the case where malaria is endemic in the mosquito population and we want to know what will happen when an epidemic is introduced into a new naive human population.\nSo the steps we will take are:\nSet \\(dI_m/dt = 0\\) and solve to find an expression for the proportion of infected mosquitos, \\(I_m\\), at this endemic point; Look at what happens to the proportion of infected humans at the beginning of the epidemic i.e. set \\(dI_h/dt \u0026gt; 0\\) (this is just like we’ve done previously e.g. with the SIR model).  1. Finding the proportion of infected mosquitos Setting \\(dI_m/dt = 0\\) and expanding out the brackets gives\n\\[\\begin{align*} ac (1 - I_m) I_h - \\gamma_m I_m \u0026amp; = 0,\\\\ ac I_h - ac I_m I_h - \\gamma_m I_m \u0026amp; = 0. \\end{align*}\\] Then isolating all terms containing \\(I_m\\) on one side, we get \\[\\begin{align*} ac I_m I_h + \\gamma_m I_m \u0026amp; = ac I_h\\\\ I_m (ac I_h + \\gamma_m) \u0026amp; = ac I_h\\\\ I_m \u0026amp; = \\frac{ac I_h}{ac I_h + \\gamma_m}.\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]  2. Considering the start of the human epidemic Setting \\(dI_h/dt \u0026gt; 0\\) and using the expression for \\(I_m\\) that we just found gives \\[\\begin{align*} amb (1 - I_h) I_m - \\gamma_h I_h \u0026amp; \u0026gt; 0,\\\\ amb (1 - I_h) \\frac{ac I_h}{ac I_h + \\gamma_m} - \\gamma_h I_h \u0026amp; \u0026gt; 0. \\end{align*}\\] Now, since we are at the start of the epidemic, we know that \\(S_h(0) = 1 - I_h(0) \\sim 1\\) (i.e. basically the entire population is suceptible), and so we can set \\(1 - I_h\\) = 1 in the above equation to simplify things to\n\\[\\begin{align*} amb \\frac{ac I_h}{ac I_h + \\gamma_m} - \\gamma_h I_h \u0026amp; \u0026gt; 0,\\\\ amb \\frac{ac}{ac I_h + \\gamma_m} - \\gamma_h \u0026amp; \u0026gt; 0,\\\\ \\frac{ambac}{ac I_h + \\gamma_m} \u0026amp; \u0026gt; \\gamma_h. \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Finally, rearranging the left hand side numerator and diving both sides by \\(\\gamma_h\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{ma^2bc}{\\gamma_h( ac I_h + \\gamma_m)} \u0026amp; \u0026gt; 1. \\end{align*}\\] Finally, we can simplify this one stage further by assuming that the initial proportion of infected humans is very small, or even zero, i.e. \\(I_h(0) \\sim 0\\). This means we can set \\(ac I_h = 0\\), so that\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{ma^2bc}{\\gamma_h\\gamma_m} \u0026amp; \u0026gt; 1. \\end{align*}\\] Therefore our final expression for \\(R_0\\) is\n\\[\\begin{align*} R_0 = \\frac{ma^2bc}{\\gamma_h\\gamma_m}. \\end{align*}\\]   ","date":1516147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516147200,"objectID":"6b3c39056a07471f80c1786726dee095","permalink":"/post/the-sis-model/","publishdate":"2018-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-sis-model/","section":"post","summary":"Background: simple SIS model Let’s start by refreshing the basics of the SIS model.

Suppose the unit of time we are considering is days, then\n \\(\\mu N\\) represents the number of births into the population per day (we assume everyone is born suceptible) \\(\\beta S I\\) represents the number of susceptible individuals that become infected per day \\(\\mu S\\) (or \\(\\mu I\\)/ \\(\\mu R\\)) is the number of susceptible (or infected/ immune) individuals that die per day. \\(\\gamma I\\) is the number of infected individuals that recover per day.  From these equations we can create a flow diagram showing the direction of movement of individuals through these compartments:\n To find the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals over time, we have to solve these equations using numerical integration methods. In this class we will use R to do this. Here’s an example of what the outcome of solving these equations looks like for a given set of parameters (\\(\\beta = 4 \\times 10^{-5}, \\mu = 7 \\times 10^{-4}, \\gamma = 1/7\\); note: this corresponds to an \\(R_0\\) of about 3).\n## Warning: `tbl_df()` is deprecated as of dplyr 1.0.0. ## Please use `tibble::as_tibble()` instead. ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. ## Call `lifecycle::last_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated.  Incorporating vaccination To incorporate vaccination we need to modify the equations above so that a proportion, \\(p\\) say, of the new births into the population are vaccinated (and thus immune to infection). Those that are vaccinated will avoid the susceptible class and go straight to the recovered class, whereas those that are unvaccinated will go into the susceptible class as before.\nIf \\(p\\) is the proportion vaccinated, then \\(1 - p\\) is the proportion left unvaccinated. Therefore the number of new births that are vaccinated (per unit time) is \\(\\mu N p\\), and the number unvaccinated is \\(\\mu N (1 - p)\\).\nOur equations therefore become:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dS}{dt} \u0026amp;= \\mu N (1 - p) -\\beta S I - \\mu S\\\\ \\frac{dI}{dt} \u0026amp;= \\beta S I - \\gamma I - \\mu I\\\\ \\frac{dR}{dt} \u0026amp;= \\gamma I - \\mu R + \\mu N p. \\end{align*}\\]\nAnd our flow diagram now looks something like this:\n Here’s the outcome of solving these equations with \\(p = 0.5\\) (and all other parameters as before). Note: now the effective reproduction number is \\(R_0 \\times (1 - p) \\sim 3 \\times 0.5 = 1.5\\).\nIn the interactive plot below you can explore what happens to the outcome as you change different model parameters, e.g:\n how does changing \\(R_0\\) impact the shape of the epidemic curve? what happens when you add in births/ deaths (i.e. change \\(\\mu = 0\\) to \\(\\mu \\geq 0\\))? what happens when you include vaccination?

However, the recent outbreak of dolphin morbillivirus in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean can provide new insights into the epidemiology and spatio-temporal spread of this pathogen. To deal with uncertainties surrounding the ecology of this system (only stranded animals were observed), we develop a statistical framework that can extract key information about the underlying transmission process given only sparse data. Our self-exciting Poisson process model suggests that individuals are infectious for at most 24 days and can transfer infection up to two latitude degrees (220 km) within this time. In addition, the effective reproduction number is generally below one, but reaches 2.6 during a period of heightened stranding numbers near Virginia Beach, Virginia, in summer 2013. Network analysis suggests local movements dominate spatial spread, with seasonal migration facilitating wider dissemination along the coast. Finally, a low virus transmission rate or high levels of pre-existing immunity can explain the lack of viral spread into the Gulf of Mexico. More generally, our approach illustrates novel methodologies for analysing very indirectly observed epidemics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Partially observed epidemics in wildlife hosts: modelling an outbreak of dolphin morbillivirus in the northwestern Atlantic, June 2013–2014","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**SE Morris**","VE Pitzer","C Viboud","CJE Metcalf","ON Bjørnstad","BT Grenfell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"9979f1efcaa97fd015b9bf84a3eb9092","permalink":"/publication/buffering/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/buffering/","section":"publication","summary":"Host demography can alter the dynamics of infectious disease. In the case of perfectly immunizing infections, observations of strong sensitivity to demographic variation have been mechanistically explained through analysis of the susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model that assumes lifelong immunity following recovery from infection. When imperfect immunity is incorporated into this framework via the susceptible–infected–recovered–susceptible (SIRS) model, with individuals regaining full susceptibility following recovery, we show that rapid loss of immunity is predicted to buffer populations against the effects of demographic change. However, this buffering is contrary to the dependence on demography recently observed for partially immunizing infections such as rotavirus and respiratory syncytial virus. We show that this discrepancy arises from a key simplification embedded in the SIR(S) framework, namely that the potential for differential immune responses to repeat exposures is ignored. We explore the minimum additional immunological information that must be included to reflect the range of observed dependencies on demography. We show that including partial protection and lower transmission following primary infection is sufficient to capture more realistic reduced levels of buffering, in addition to changes in epidemic timing, across a range of partially and fully immunizing infections. Furthermore, our results identify key variables in this relationship, including R0.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Demographic buffering -- titrating the effects of birth rate and imperfect immunity on epidemic dynamics","type":"publication"}]
