      <description>shinySIR is an open-source R packge that provides interactive plotting for mathematical models of infectious disease spread. Users can choose from a variety of common built-in ODE models (such as the SIR, SIRS, and SIS models), or create their own. This latter flexibility allows shinySIR to be applied to simple ODEs from any discipline. The package is a useful teaching tool as students can visualize how changing different parameters can impact model dynamics, with minimal knowledge of coding in R.</description>

      <title>Analysis of tissue-resident memory T cell population dynamics</title>

      <description>This analysis illustrates how a simple mathematical model can be applied to experimental data of tissue resident memory T cells in nonlymphoid tissues. The aim is to estimate the clonal half-life of each population and project dynamics beyond experimental timeframes.
Full background and model details can be found in Morris et al (2019) Journal of Immunology.</description>

      <title>ushr: Understanding suppression of HIV in R</title>

      <description>In 2017, HIV/AIDS was responsible for the deaths of one million people globally, including 50,000 children less than one year old. Although mathematical modeling has provided important insights into the dynamics of HIV infection during anti-retroviral treatment (ART), there is still a lack of accessible tools for researchers unfamiliar with modeling techniques to apply them to their own datasets.
ushr is an open-source R package that models the decline of HIV during ART using a popular mathematical framework.</description>
